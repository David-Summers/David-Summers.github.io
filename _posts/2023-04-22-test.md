Are you looking to deploy a web app on Azure? Look no further! In this guide, we will walk you through the process step-by-step.

First, log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to the App Service section. Click on the "Add" button to create a new app service.

Next, choose the subscription, resource group, and name for your app service. Select the runtime stack and operating system that you want to use, and choose the region where you want to deploy your app.

Once you have configured your app service, you can deploy your web app. You can choose to deploy your app from a local Git repository, from a public Git repository, or from a ZIP package.

After you have deployed your app, you can configure custom domains, SSL certificates, and other settings. You can also monitor and scale your app service as needed.

And that's it! By following these steps, you can deploy a web app on Azure in no time. Stay tuned for more Azure tips and tricks on this blog.
